# Dijkstra’s Three Golden Rules for Successful Scientific Research

## Rule 1
**Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities.** This rule emphasizes the importance of pushing one's own limits and not settling for mediocrity. Dijkstra believed that engaging with challenging problems that test one's abilities is crucial for significant scientific advancement.

**将你的质量标准提高到你能够承受的最高水平，避免浪费时间在常规问题上，始终尽可能地在你能力的边界工作。** 这条规则强调了挑战自己极限和不满足于平庸的重要性。迪科斯彻认为，从事挑战自己能力的难题对于科学的重大进步至关重要。


## Rule 2
**Do not work for many audiences at once: try to please fellow scientists, satisfy your artistic conscience, or solve practical problems.** This rule stresses the importance of focus in research. Dijkstra suggested that trying to address too many objectives simultaneously can dilute the quality and impact of one's work. It's important to have a clear primary audience or goal in mind.

**不要同时为多个受众工作：试图取悦同行科学家，满足你的艺术良知，或解决实际问题。** 这条规则强调了研究中专注的重要性。迪科斯彻建议，同时尝试解决太多目标可能会稀释人们工作的质量和影响。重要的是要有一个清晰的主要受众或目标。


## Rule 3
**Never tackle a problem of which you can be pretty sure that (now or in the near future) it will be tackled by others who have more means than you.** This guideline advises against investing effort in problems that are likely to be solved by others who have more resources. Dijkstra's view was that it's better to focus on unique problems where an individual researcher can make a meaningful and distinctive contribution.

**永远不要去解决一个问题，你可以相当肯定的是，现在或在不久的将来，它将被其他拥有比你更多资源的人解决。** 这个指导原则建议不要在那些很可能被其他资源更丰富的人解决的问题上投入努力。迪科斯彻的观点是，最好专注于独特的问题，在这些问题上个人研究者可以做出有意义和独特的贡献。
