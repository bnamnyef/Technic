    "`apt` and `apt-get` are both command-line tools used for handling packages in Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions¹².\n",
    "\n",
    "\"`apt`和`apt-get`都是用于处理Ubuntu和其他基于Debian的Linux发行版的命令行工具。\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User-Friendliness**: `apt` is designed to be more user-friendly and provides a more structured way to manage packages¹². It combines the most commonly used command options from `apt-get`, `apt-cache`, and `apt-config`¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **用户友好性**：`apt`旨在更加用户友好，并提供更结构化的方式来管理包。它结合了`apt-get`，`apt-cache`和`apt-config`中最常用的命令选项。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Command Availability**: Most commonly used commands from `apt-get` and `apt-cache` are available in `apt`¹. Some of the commands that `apt` includes are `list`, `search`, `show`, `update`, `install`, `remove`, `upgrade`, `full-upgrade`, and `edit-sources`¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **命令可用性**：`apt-get`和`apt-cache`中最常用的命令在`apt`中都可用。`apt`包含的一些命令有`list`，`search`，`show`，`update`，`install`，`remove`，`upgrade`，`full-upgrade`和`edit-sources`。\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output**: The output of `apt` may change between versions as it's designed for end-users (human), whereas `apt-get` may be considered as lower-level and \"back-end\", supporting other APT-based tools¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **输出**：`apt`的输出可能会在版本之间改变，因为它是为最终用户（人类）设计的，而`apt-get`可能被视为较低级别和\"后端\"，支持其他基于APT的工具。\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Usage**: `apt` is meant for end users, while `apt-get` is meant for system use⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **用途**：`apt`面向最终用户，而`apt-get`面向系统使用。\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Backward Compatibility**: `apt-get` is included in modern versions of Ubuntu for backward compatibility, and is often relied upon in scripts and documentation³.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **向后兼容性**：`apt-get`包含在Ubuntu的现代版本中以实现向后兼容性，并且经常在脚本和文档中依赖。\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while they have similar functionalities, `apt` is a more modern and user-friendly interface, whereas `apt-get` provides a lower-level interface and is used for system-level tasks⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 总的来说，虽然它们具有相似的功能，但`apt`是一个更现代化和用户友好的界面，而`apt-get`提供了一个较低级别的界面，并用于系统级任务。\n"
